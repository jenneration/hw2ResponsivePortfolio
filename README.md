# Unit 02 Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This is an exercise in using CSS, Bootstrap and Media Queries to create a mobile responsive "bio" site.

## Criteria for site:

### Utilize
* Bootstrap
    - Navbar
    - Responsive layout
    - Responsive images
* CSS
* Minimal Media Queries   
* Make 3 pages: index., portfolio., and contact.html.
* Include screenshots in the ReadMe. (NOT SURE HOW TO DO THIS YET)

### Minimum requirements attempted and completed:

* Use Bootstrap's grid system
* Cross browswer compatibility
* HTML validation (used HTML5 Validator.nu)
* GitHub repo and Readme
* All links must work
* Use semantic html
* Must contain personal info
* Must properly use Bootstrap components and grid system.

### Bonus

* Use Bootstrap stick footer, use subrows and sub columns. (FIXED FUOOTER BUT DID NOT VENTURE INTO SUB ROWS/COLS YET.)

## My experience and issues

* I wanted to utilize Bootstrap styling whenever possible to A) learn as much about it as possible and B) to consolidate code.
* Bec. this is new I spent the most time researching, testing and deliberating on when/how to use Bootstrap vs CSS vs Media Queries.
* Future practice is def in order and it would be helpful to know and I'm adding Photoshop and Illustrator lessons to study so I can properly manipulate images and create custom graphics.
* Most challenging parts:
    * Controlling responsive behavior on text and images.
    * Learning flex-box on the fly to understand and grasp styling for Bootstrap grid behavior.
