## My experience and issues

* I wanted to utilize to Bootstrap styling whenever possible to A) learn as much about it a possible and B) to consolidate code.
* Bec. this is new I spent the most time researching, testing and deliberating on when/how to use it, and when CSS and Media Queries were necessary.
* Future practice is in order and it would be helpful to know Photoshop and Illustrator for the future so I can properly manipulate images and create custom graphics.
* Most challenging parts:
    * Controlling responsive behavior on text and images.
    * Learning flex-box on the fly to understand and grasp styling for Bootstrap grid behavior.
